# frozen_string_literal: true

# routes.rb style guidance:
#
# - Root at the top
# - Unscoped routes next; group them logically
# - Throw everything else in a scope, alphabetically ordered.
# - Within a scope, unscoped routes go _after_ everything else.
# - Unscoped mounts at the bottom.
#
# RubyMine hint: Within the draw block, Ctrl-Shift-Minus followed by Ctrl-= (or cmd, whatever system you're on)
# will collapse everything and then expand the top level again so you just see unscoped routes plus scopes. Makes
# it much easier to see where everything is.
